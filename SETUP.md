# BarbaBB Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up BarbaBB with the correct OpenBB dependency.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- pip

## Understanding Our OpenBB Fork

BarbaBB uses a custom fork of OpenBB Platform located at:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/barbapapadev-ops/OpenBB
- **Branch**: `develop`

This fork contains modifications specific to BarbaBB's needs.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Direct Installation from GitHub (Recommended for Users)

This method installs OpenBB directly from our fork without needing to clone it separately.

```bash
# Clone BarbaBB
git clone git@github.com:barbapapadev-ops/BarbaBB.git
cd BarbaBB

# Install all dependencies (including OpenBB from our fork)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` specifies our OpenBB fork:
```
git+https://github.com/barbapapadev-ops/OpenBB.git@develop#egg=openbb
```

### Method 2: Editable Installation (Recommended for Developers)

Use this if you need to modify OpenBB code alongside BarbaBB development.

```bash
# Clone both repositories in the same parent directory
cd /your/workspace
git clone https://github.com/barbapapadev-ops/OpenBB.git
git clone git@github.com:barbapapadev-ops/BarbaBB.git

# Install OpenBB in editable mode
cd OpenBB
git checkout develop
pip install -e .

# Install BarbaBB dependencies
cd ../BarbaBB
pip install matplotlib
```

With editable installation, changes to OpenBB code are immediately reflected without reinstalling.

### Method 3: Using a Specific Commit (For Reproducibility)

To ensure everyone uses the exact same version:

```bash
# Find the current commit hash
cd OpenBB
git log -1 --oneline
# Example output: 15f084ef6 chore: update autogenerated reference.json

# Update requirements.txt to use specific commit
# Replace @develop with @15f084ef6 in requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/barbapapadev-ops/OpenBB.git@15f084ef6#egg=openbb
```

## Verifying Installation

After installation, verify OpenBB is correctly installed:

```bash
python -c "import openbb; print(openbb.__version__)"
```

## Updating Dependencies

### Updating to Latest Fork Version

```bash
# Method 1 users:
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/barbapapadev-ops/OpenBB.git@develop#egg=openbb

# Method 2 users:
cd OpenBB
git pull origin develop
pip install -e .
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors
If you get import errors, ensure you're in the correct environment:
```bash
pip list | grep openbb
```

### Conflicting OpenBB Versions
If you have the official OpenBB installed, uninstall it first:
```bash
pip uninstall openbb
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### SSH Key Issues
If cloning fails, ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub:
```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## Contributing

When contributing to BarbaBB:
1. Always use the `develop` branch of our OpenBB fork
2. Document any new OpenBB modifications in the OpenBB repository
3. Keep BarbaBB's requirements.txt updated
